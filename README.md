# Real Time Tracking

In this project, we use the GMM(Gaussian Mixture Models) method for background subtraction and compare it with the inbuilt opencv MoG method. The background subtraction find its applications in real-time tracking.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to implement the real-time object tracking algorithm using background subtraction
and a Mixture of Gaussians. The implementation is done using the research paper based on "Adpative background mixture models for real time tracking".

## Dataset
A video file, shared along with repository

## Technologies
The project uses Python >= 3.8

Other technologies used
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* Scipy.stats
* Numpy

How to use?(in local machine)
* Setup the python environment in local machine. Prefer a virtual environment
* Setup the Conda setup
* Install the required libraries
